## Problem Statement
- Financial literacy not formally taught
- Lack of savings among millenials
- Lack of discipline to save

There are existing solutions or spending trackers such as Seedly that monitor the user's expenses and the categories.

However, they do not cater to a younger audience as they lack the discipline to use the application on a consistent basis.

## Approach

We came up with **PetSaver**, a mobile application that aid users in saving money through a gamified experience with the help of a virtual pet.


Our process:
Online survey
User Interviews

Targeted user groups:
Primary: Young Adults (21 ~ 25 y/o)
Secondary: Teenagers (13 ~ 20 y/o)


Mobile App that aids user in saving money through a gamified experience and with a help of a virtual pet
Designed app prototype on Figma with demo. Wrote persona and storyboards, directed, and edited the promotion video, ensured consistency and quality across different pages in the app
Conducted user study, analysed data and further evaluation of userâ€™s needs and wants and improvisation on app prototype to ensure PetSaver is fun and easy for the user to use
