I am glad to have been given the opportunity to work on this amazing project. This has been a really challenging project and I have learnt a lot, it has been an awesome time working with cum. m+d!

I was the render wrangler, checking the overall progress of all the shots (to see which one is ready for compositing, render errors) and later on, I was responsible for compositing a few heavy and complex shots.

Contributions: 
- Motion tracked moving shots, composite different elements into one shot (matte painting, characters, tanks), enhanced the shot with color correcting
- Cleaned up and enhanced shots with color correcting
- Assisted in sending the 3D renders to the renderfarm and checking the quality of the renders.

Here are some of the stills I have worked on:
