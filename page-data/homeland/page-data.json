It was a challenge as it was a heavy VFX shot, I have to think of how to work across multiple softwares as I was using Maya for modelling and Houdini for the fracturing of the pieces, smoke and debris. As I was using both Maya and Houdini Engine, there was a compatibility issue due to using different softwares, one such example was that there was problem importing and exporting of files/swimming textures, I learnt how to adapt or fix technical issues along the way by trying various methods.</p>\n<p>It was a great challenge as I was given a difficult scene, where I have to roughly model the layout of the room, and then make the ground collapse and also clean up the background plate and put everything together.</p>\n<center><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGQN9QBJ1Io?start=114\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></center>\n<p><img src=\"./homeland.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I had the privilege to go on site in Penang, where the filming took place and observe.
